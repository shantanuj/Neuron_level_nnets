Neuron focused neural networks: A playground for creating neural network models from bottom up.

The code is not meant to be scalable and does not use computation graphs, and other tweaks that deep learning frameworks possess. Instead the focus is on:

1) Understanding how to create and tune neural net architectures.
2) The decoupling of neurons, layers and networks as separate OOP classes allows to add intersting properties to each.
