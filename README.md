Neuron focused neural networks: A playground for creating neural network models from bottom up.

The code is not meant to be scalable and does not use computation graphs, and other tweaks that deep learning frameworks possess. Instead the focus is on:

1) Understanding how to create and tune neural net architectures.
2) Decoupling of neurons, layers and networks as OOP classes which allows addition of intersting properties and experiments to each.
